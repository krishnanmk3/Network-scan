     Potential Security Risks from Open Ports
1. Port 5357 - WSDAPI (Web Services on Devices API)
? Service: Used for automatic device discovery (printers, IoT devices) in Windows networks.
? Security Risks:
? Network Reconnaissance: Attackers can scan devices on the network.
? Denial-of-Service (DoS): Vulnerable to WS-Discovery amplification attacks.
? Information Leakage: May expose device details (hostnames, services).
? Exploitable Vulnerabilities: Past flaws in WSDAPI could allow remote code execution (e.g., CVE-2017-0147).
2. Port 80 - HTTP (Unencrypted Web Traffic)
? Service: Serves websites without encryption.
? Security Risks:
? Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can intercept/modify traffic.
? Credential Theft: Login pages without HTTPS expose passwords.
? Web Application Attacks: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF if the server is misconfigured.
? Cache Poisoning: Can manipulate unencrypted web caches.
3. Port 443 - HTTPS (Encrypted Web Traffic)
? Service: Secures web traffic via TLS/SSL.
? Security Risks:
? Weak Encryption: Outdated TLS (1.0/1.1) or weak ciphers can be broken.
? Certificate Issues: Expired, self-signed, or misconfigured certs lead to trust exploits.
? Known Exploits: Vulnerabilities like Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) or POODLE (CVE-2014-3566) if using old protocols.
? SSL Stripping Attacks: If HTTP ? HTTPS redirection is not enforced.
4. Port 6881 - BitTorrent Tracker
? Service: Manages peer connections for P2P file sharing.
? Security Risks:
? Malware Distribution: Torrents often contain disguised malware.
? IP Exposure: Your IP is publicly logged in torrent swarms (DDoS/legal risks).
? Bandwidth Abuse: Can be used for illegal file sharing, attracting legal notices.
? Exploitable Clients: Some BitTorrent clients have had RCE flaws (e.g., libtorrent vulnerabilities).
